# Archived News Website about a Sports Club

The project aimed to collect news published on the web about a football club since the beginning of the century and make them available on a website.

## Introduction

In the year following the centenary of Sporting Clube da Covilhã, the aim was
to use the resources of [Arquivo.pt](https://arquivo.pt/) - a platform for preserving content from the
Portuguese web - to make accessible to the public the set of news published
over this century on the digital platforms of the main media outlets in the
Beira Interior region - Rádio Cova da Beira, Rádio Caria, Rádio Clube da Covilhã, and Notícias da Covilhã - focusing on the main club of the city of Covilhã.
In particular, this project aimed to make these contents available through the
development of a dedicated website and a search system that allows users of
the web platform to retrieve information about the club from the data collected from Arquivo.pt. After extracting the news from these four websites (a total of 12111 news articles), we
implemented a filter to select only the news related to Sporting Clube da Covilhã. This process resulted in the retrieval of 822 news articles. This data are subsequently loaded and indexed
in a NoSQL database and embedded in the developed website (in highlighted
news that happened a certain number of years ago, and accessible through a
search system).
Arquivo de Notícias SCC - avaliable by the URL: http://arquivoscc.ipt.pt/ -
is based on the retrieval of news about Sporting Clube da Covilhã from the
beginning of the century using Arquivo.pt.
The aim of this project was to contribute to the preservation of local sports
heritage and the collective memory of a historic sports institution in the Beira
Interior and the country, Sporting Clube da Covilhã, and also to recover and
preserve information - and consequently, history - from some of the main media outlets in the Beira Interior region.


This project required expertise in Python, NoSQL databases (Elasticsearch), RESTful APIs, Flask, web programming languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), Nginx, and Docker.
